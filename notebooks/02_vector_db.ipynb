gain or loss reported in earnings during 2005 .\\nthe total amount for these swaps was recorded in other comprehensive income and was a net loss of $ 2 million during 2005 , which will be amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of the notes .\\nat year-end 2005 , we had six outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the

.\\nthe aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts is $ 27 million at year-end 2005 .\\nthese contracts have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges .\\nchanges in their fair values are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income .\\nthe fair value of the option contracts is approximately zero at year-end 2005 and 2004 .\\nduring 2004 , it was deter- mined that certain derivatives were no longer effective in offsetting the hedged item .\\nthus , cash flow hedge accounting treatment was discontinued and the ineffective con- tracts resulted in a loss of $ 1 million , which was reported in earnings for 2004 .\\nthe remaining hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2005 , 2004

.\\npurchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $ 6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $ 3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 , mostly in the rm&t segment .\\nthe decrease in

rm&t depreciation expense increase in 2006 .\\ne&p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $ 20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline .\\nnatural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well .\\nselling , general and administrative expenses increased $ 73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 134 million in 2005 from 2004 .\\nthe 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity .\\npartially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense .\\nthe increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense , due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards , which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004 .\\nexploration expenses increased $ 148

favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances , foreign currency exchange gains , adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest .\\nthe decrease in expense for 2005 was primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and greater capitalized interest , partially offset by increased interest on potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses .\\nincluded in net interest and other financing costs ( income ) are foreign currency gains of $ 16 million , losses of $ 17 million and gains of $ 9 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 .\\nminority interest in income of mpc decreased $ 148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to our acquisition of the 38

.\\nannual contributions to the plan are based on fixed percentages of participants 2019 salaries and years of service , not to exceed certain maximums .\\npension cost was $ 13.9 million , $ 12.8

states corporate tax on income from the international opera- tion of ships pursuant to section 883 of the internal revenue code .\\nincome tax expense related to our remaining subsidiaries was not significant for the years ended december 31 , 2006 , 2005 and 2004 .\\nfinal regulations under section 883 were published on august 26 , 2003 , and were effective for the year ended december 31 , 2005 .\\nthese regulations confirmed that we qualify for the exemption provid- ed by section 883 , but also narrowed the scope of activities which are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships .\\nthe activities listed in the regula- tions as not being incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of air and other transportation such as transfers , shore excursions and pre and post cruise tours .\\nto the extent the income from such activities is earned from sources within the united states , such income will be subject to united states taxa- tion .\\nthe application of these new regulations reduced our net income for the years ended december 31 , 2006 and december 31 , 2005 by approximately $ 6.3 million and $ 14.0 million , respectively .\\nnote 11 .\\nfinancial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows ( in thousands ) : .\\n\\n|

a net payable position ( 20456 ) ( 78 ) the reported fair values are based on a variety of factors and assumptions .\\naccordingly , the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of december 31 , 2006 or 2005 , or that will be realized in the future and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement .\\nour financial instruments are not held for trading or speculative purposes .\\nour exposure under foreign currency contracts , interest rate and fuel swap agreements is limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts , all of which are currently our lending banks .\\nto minimize this risk , we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we limit our exposure to an individual counterparty .\\nfurthermore , all foreign currency forward contracts are denominated in primary currencies .\\ncash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the short maturity of these instruments .\\nlong-term debt the fair values of our senior notes and senior debentures were esti- mated by obtaining quoted market prices .\\nthe fair values of all other debt were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on market rates available to us for similar debt with the same remaining maturities .\\nforeign currency contracts the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were esti- mated using current market prices for similar instruments .\\nour expo- sure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to six ship construction contracts and forecasted transactions .\\nwe use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates .\\nas of december 31 , 2006 , we had foreign currency forward contracts in a notional amount of $ 3.8 billion maturing through 2009 .\\nas of december 31 , 2006 , the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the six ship construction contracts , which are designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized gain of approximately $ 106.3 mil- lion .\\nat december 31 , 2005 , the fair value of our foreign currency for- ward contracts related to three ship construction contracts , designated as fair value hedges , was a net unrealized loss of approx- imately $ 103.4 million .\\nthe fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts related to the other ship construction contract at december 31 , 2005 , which was designated as a cash flow hedge , was an unre- alized loss , of approximately $ 7.8 million .\\nat december 31 , 2006 , approximately 11% ( 11 % ) of the aggregate cost of the ships was exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate .\\nr o y a l c a r i b b e a n c r u i s e s l t d .\\n3 5 notes to the consolidated financial statements (
